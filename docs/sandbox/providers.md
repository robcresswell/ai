---

A provider owns the isolation primitive: where the harness actually runs. Every
provider implements the same `SandboxProvider` / `SandboxHandle` contract, so the
[workspace](./workspace) you hand the agent and the [policy](./policy) that guards
it are provider-agnostic. Pick a provider for the isolation, auth, and
snapshot/resume behaviour you need; the rest of your sandbox definition stays the
same.

Provider-native snapshots and resume keep or recreate provider state. They can
reduce bootstrap time. [Portable Snapshots](./portable-snapshots) store
completed workspace data in your application persistence for reconstruction.

> The provider is _where_ the agent runs. For _which_ agent runs (Grok Build,
> Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or any ACP agent via `acpCompatible`) see
> [Harnesses](./harnesses).

## Choosing a provider

| Provider | Package | Isolation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local process | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process` | none (host) | The fast, no-Docker dev loop. Trusted/dev use only. |
| Docker | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker` | container | Real isolation; commit-based snapshots, fork, resume-by-id. |
| Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`) | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker` | microVM | Native Docker Sandboxes. Same package as `dockerSandbox()`, different export: `sbxSandbox()`. Needs the `sbx` CLI, a login, and a hypervisor. |
| Daytona | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/) sandboxes; snapshots after setup, port preview links, resume-by-id. Needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. |
| Vercel | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel` | microVM | Managed [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/sandbox) microVMs; exposed-port domains, resume-by-id (persistent). Needs `VERCEL_TOKEN` + team/project. |
| Sprites | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-sprites` | stateful sandbox | Managed [Sprites](https://sprites.dev) (Fly.io) sandboxes; durable filesystem, in-place checkpoints, single proxied public-URL port, resume-by-id. Needs `SPRITES_API_KEY`. |
| Upstash Box | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Upstash Box](https://github.com/upstash/box) sandboxes; interactive processes over a WebSocket session (real pid, stdin, signals), native snapshots, preview URLs, resume-by-id. Needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`. |
| Blaxel | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel` | cloud sandbox | Managed [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai) sandboxes; durable filesystem, per-port preview URLs, native file watch, resume-by-id. Snapshot/fork remain disabled while the source-scoped private-preview semantics are unproven. Accepts `BL_API_KEY` + `BL_WORKSPACE` or SDK-resolved CLI or client credentials. |
| E2B | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-e2b` | microVM | Managed [E2B](https://e2b.dev) Firecracker sandboxes. Native snapshots and fork, preview URLs, writable stdin, process-group kill, resume-by-id (also wakes a paused sandbox). Needs `E2B_API_KEY`. |
| boxd | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-boxd` | microVM | Managed [boxd](https://boxd.sh) KVM microVMs; live fork (memory and processes), snapshots that restore into a new machine, persistent disk, resume-by-id across stop, suspend and hibernate, one public HTTPS URL per machine. Needs `BOXD_API_KEY` + `BOXD_ORG`. |
| microsandbox | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-microsandbox` | microVM (local) | [microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox) microVMs on your own machine. No cloud account and no Docker daemon. Disk snapshots, live fork, resume-by-id. Needs KVM, Apple Silicon, or WHP. |
| Railway | `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-railway` | microVM | Managed [Railway](https://railway.com) sandboxes. Private networking to your other Railway services, live disk fork, environment-scoped checkpoints that survive deletion of their source, durable exec sessions, create-time HTTP domains, resume-by-id. Needs `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_TOKEN` + an environment. |

Most providers are their own package. `dockerSandbox()` and `sbxSandbox()` both
come from `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker`. The constructor is the only thing that
differs between them:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'
import { dockerSandbox, sbxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'
import { vercelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel'
import { upstashBoxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box'
import { blaxelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel'
import { e2bSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-e2b'
import { boxdSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-boxd'
import { railwaySandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-railway'
import { microsandboxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-microsandbox'

const dev = localProcessSandbox() // runs on your host
const isolated = dockerSandbox({ image: 'node:22' }) // container
const microvm = sbxSandbox() // Docker Sandboxes microVM
const daytona = daytonaSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY }) // managed cloud sandbox
const vercel = vercelSandbox({ runtime: 'node24' }) // managed Vercel microVM
const box = upstashBoxSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY }) // managed Upstash Box
const blaxel = blaxelSandbox() // managed Blaxel sandbox; uses API-key or CLI credentials
const e2b = e2bSandbox() // managed E2B microVM; reads E2B_API_KEY
const boxd = boxdSandbox({ org: 'acme' }) // managed boxd microVM; reads BOXD_API_KEY
const railway = railwaySandbox() // managed Railway sandbox; reads RAILWAY_TOKEN + RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID
const local = microsandboxSandbox() // microVM on this host; no credentials
```

> co-located model.

## Local process

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const dev = localProcessSandbox()
```

- **Isolation:** none. The harness runs directly on your host, inheriting your
  host environment. Use it for trusted or dev work only. There is no boundary
  between the agent and your machine.
- **Auth / env:** inherits the host environment. Set `authMode` on the harness
  (`'host'` or `'api-key'`). The provider does not pick this. See
  [Harness Auth](./auth).
- **Snapshot / resume:** no snapshots and no durable resume-by-id; each run
  re-creates and re-bootstraps under the same identity. The snapshot step is
  skipped silently (see [Capabilities](#capabilities)).

### Host login vs API key (`scrubEnv`)

The provider is where the agent runs, not how it signs in. The default
`authMode` is `'api-key'`. Set `'host'` when the machine already has a CLI
login. A local-process run can be your laptop or a GitHub runner. See
[Harness Auth](./auth).

`localProcessSandbox` inherits the host environment, including any API keys
exported there. If you set `authMode: 'host'`, pass `scrubEnv` so those keys
do not override the CLI login:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const hostLogin = localProcessSandbox({
  scrubEnv: ['XAI_API_KEY', 'GROK_API_KEY'],
})
```

If the same local-process sandbox runs on a CI machine, set
`authMode: 'api-key'`. Then inject the key as a workspace secret. Isolated and
cloud providers have no host CLI login. Use `authMode: 'api-key'` and
workspace secrets there.

### Windows process teardown (`logger`)

Killing a spawned process means killing the whole tree, and on Windows that takes
more than `taskkill /T`. Commands run through a git-bash `sh`, and MSYS's
fork emulation runs the final command of a statement list, such as the
`tail -f` behind a [journal](./journal) follow read, under an intermediate shell
that immediately exits. Windows never reparents, so the surviving process points
at a dead parent and `taskkill /T`, which walks only live parent links, cannot
reach it **while still exiting `0`**. Left alone, every follow read leaks a
process for the life of the machine.

`localProcessSandbox` therefore consults MSYS's own process table, which does
keep the logical parentage before killing, then kills any descendant `/T` missed.
Teardown is total by construction: it never throws, because a throwing kill would
strand a run mid-flight. That means a kill it genuinely cannot complete (a
protected process, access denied) is otherwise invisible, so pass a `logger` to
see it:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const dev = localProcessSandbox({
  logger: {
    warn: (message, meta) => console.warn(message, meta),
  },
})
```

Any object with a `warn(message, meta?)` method works, so the `InternalLogger`
your adapter already receives can be handed straight in. A process that had
already exited on its own is **not** a failure and is never reported.

Nothing here changes on POSIX, where `sh` really is the command's parent and
signalling the wrapper is enough.

## Docker

```ts
import { dockerSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'

const isolated = dockerSandbox({ image: 'node:22' })
```

- **Isolation:** a real container boundary between the agent and your host.
- **Auth / env:** no host login; provide credentials as workspace secrets, which
  are injected into the container env at create/resume. The agent reaches host
  tools over `host.docker.internal` (see [tools](./tools)).
- **Snapshot / resume:** full commit-based snapshots, `fork`, and resume-by-id.
  Bootstrap snapshots after `setup` completes, so subsequent runs resume from the
  snapshot instead of re-running setup.

## Docker Sandboxes (sbx)

```ts
import { sbxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker'
import { defineSandbox, defineWorkspace, githubRepo } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'

const isolated = sbxSandbox({
  allowNetwork: ['*.npmjs.org', 'registry.npmjs.org'],
})

const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  id: 'repo-agent',
  provider: isolated,
  workspace: defineWorkspace({
    source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/repo' }),
    setup: ['pnpm install'],
  }),
})
```

- **Isolation:** a hypervisor microVM. The sandbox has its own kernel and its own Docker daemon. This is not `dockerSandbox()`, which starts a container.
- **Needs:** `sbx` on `PATH`, `sbx login` (or a PAT piped to `sbx login --password-stdin` in CI), and a hypervisor (Hyper-V, Virtualization.framework, or KVM). A Docker socket is not enough.
- **Workspace:** `sbx create --clone` copies a host Git repo into the VM. Pass `workspaceDir` that contains `.git`, or set `workspace.source` to a git URL. If there is no Git repo, create throws. There is no bind-mount fallback.
- **Auth / env:** inject API keys as workspace secrets. v1 does not call `sbx secret`.
- **Snapshot / resume:** no snapshots and no fork. Resume reconnects by name (`sbx ls`). A stopped sandbox starts again on the next `sbx exec`.
- **Network:** this is the first provider with `networkPolicy: true`. See [Policy](./policy).

## Daytona

```ts
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'

const daytona = daytonaSandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY,
  snapshot: 'daytona-medium',
  autoStopInterval: 0,
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed cloud sandbox on a remote VM you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. Put harness credentials in
  [workspace secrets](./provisioning). At create and snapshot restore,
  Daytona stores each value as an organization Secret and mounts a
  placeholder in the sandbox env. The create record, the dashboard env
  view, and session command strings do not contain the real value. Daytona
  substitutes the value on outbound HTTPS requests. Per-command `opts.env`
  uses `executeCommand`'s env argument or a sourced env file. It never
  writes `export KEY=` prefixes into the command string.
- **Snapshot / resume:** point-in-time snapshots after setup (default when
  `lifecycle.snapshot` is `'after-setup'`). Pass `snapshot` on
  `daytonaSandbox()` to pick the Daytona image (for example
  `'daytona-medium'`). Resume starts a `stopped` or `archived` sandbox, then
  returns the handle.
- **Idle stop:** Daytona stops an idle sandbox after 15 minutes by default.
  Set `autoStopInterval` in minutes to change that. Pass `0` to turn auto-stop
  off. Set `ephemeral: true` to delete the sandbox when it stops.
- **Network:** `policy.capabilities.network: 'deny'` blocks all outbound
  network on create.
- **Working directory:** the portable root `/workspace` maps to
  `/home/daytona/workspace` by default. Override with `workdir` on
  `daytonaSandbox()` if you need another path.
- **Stdin:** spawned processes accept host stdin (`writableStdin: true`).
- **Privileges:** the Daytona user is not root. Package installs in `setup`
  must use `sudo -n` (for example `sudo -n apt-get install …`). Do not put
  `sudo *` in a [policy](./policy) deny list for this provider.
- **Bridge:** the sandbox is remote, so a [bridged tool](./tools) call cannot
  reach your laptop's `localhost`. In local dev, tunnel the bridge (see
  [tools](./tools)). A deployed orchestrator is reachable without a tunnel.

Default headless path on Daytona:

```ts
import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { grokBuildText } from '@tanstack/ai-grok-build'
import {
  defineSandbox,
  defineSandboxPolicy,
  defineWorkspace,
  gitSkill,
  githubRepo,
  withSandbox,
} from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { daytonaSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-daytona'

const sandbox = defineSandbox({
  id: 'daytona-agent',
  provider: daytonaSandbox({
    apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY,
    snapshot: 'daytona-medium',
  }),
  workspace: defineWorkspace({
    source: githubRepo({ repo: 'owner/app' }),
    skills: [gitSkill({ repo: 'owner/skills-pack' })],
  }),
  policy: defineSandboxPolicy({
    default: 'allow',
  }),
})

const stream = chat({
  adapter: grokBuildText('grok-build'),
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'List the project files.' }],
  middleware: [withSandbox(sandbox)],
})
```

Headless Grok Build and Codex stay on auto-approve with `default: 'allow'`.
Isolation is the Daytona VM. Use Claude Code when you need command-level deny.

## Vercel

```ts
import { vercelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-vercel'

const vercel = vercelSandbox({ runtime: 'node24' })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed microVM (Vercel Sandbox).
- **Auth / env:** needs `VERCEL_TOKEN` plus a team/project. Harness credentials
  are injected as workspace secrets.
- **Snapshot / resume:** persistent resume-by-id with a durable filesystem, plus
  exposed-port domains for previews.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need the tunnel in local
  dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Sprites

```ts
import { spritesSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-sprites'

const sprites = spritesSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.SPRITES_API_KEY })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Sprites](https://sprites.dev) stateful sandbox
  (Fly.io), a remote VM you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `SPRITES_API_KEY` (token form
  `org/projectNumber/tokenId/secret`); override the control-plane URL with
  `apiUrl` / `SPRITES_API_URL`. Harness credentials are injected as workspace
  secrets.
- **Snapshot / resume:** resume-by-id reconnects to the named Sprite (its
  filesystem is durable across idle suspend/resume). `snapshot()` creates a
  Sprite **checkpoint** (a save point of the writable overlay); restore is
  **in-place** on the same Sprite via the handle's `restoreCheckpoint()` /
  `listCheckpoints()`. A checkpoint does not survive Sprite deletion, so the
  provider intentionally does **not** implement the reconstruct-after-gone
  `restoreSnapshot`, when a Sprite is gone the framework degrades to a fresh
  create instead. Restore restarts the environment and can take minutes;
  `restoreCheckpoint()` polls the workspace until it is listable again before
  resolving. Note that immediately after a restore the overlay can be listable
  while individual file reads briefly return an I/O error as it settles, so retry
  reads if you act on the filesystem the instant restore returns.
- **Ports:** a Sprite proxies a single internal HTTP port (default `8080`,
  configurable via `httpPort`) to its always-on public URL. `ports.connect(8080)`
  switches the URL to `public` auth and returns it; other ports are not exposed.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona and Vercel, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need the tunnel in
  local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Upstash Box

```ts
import { upstashBoxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-upstash-box'

const box = upstashBoxSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Upstash Box](https://github.com/upstash/box) cloud
  sandbox, a remote container you do not run yourself.
- **Auth / env:** needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY` (or `apiKey`); override the API
  base with `baseUrl` / `UPSTASH_BOX_BASE_URL`. Pick the image and size with
  `runtime` (default `node`) and `size`.
- **Paths:** the conventional `/workspace` virtual root maps to the box home,
  `/workspace/home`, which is the handle's `workspaceRoot`.
- **Processes:** `spawn()` opens a live `exec.session` over a WebSocket, so a
  background process has a real in-box pid, a writable stdin, separate stdout and
  stderr, and server-side signals. A session owns its process: dropping the
  connection kills the command and sessions cannot be reattached, so `spawn()` is
  scoped to the lifetime of the handle rather than the box. Blocking `exec()`
  stays on the HTTP path and is shell-wrapped for `cwd`/env, which the session
  takes natively.
- **Snapshot / resume:** `snapshot()` calls `box.snapshot()` and
  `restoreSnapshot()` reconstructs a new box from it via `Box.fromSnapshot()`, so
  a snapshot survives deletion of the box that made it. Resume-by-id uses
  `Box.get` (id or name) and probes `getStatus`, so a deleted record resumes as
  `null` rather than a tombstone handle.
- **Ports:** `ports.connect(port)` mints a preview URL via `getPublicURL`. Pass
  `publicUrlAuth` to gate it, `{ bearerToken: true }` returns a token plus an
  `Authorization: Bearer` header and `{ basicAuth: true }` returns Basic
  credentials; without it the preview URL is unauthenticated.
- **Network:** a `policy.capabilities.network` of `'deny'` maps to Box's
  `deny-all` egress mode. The contract's gate is coarse, so Box's domain and CIDR
  allowlists are not reachable through it. This is stricter than providers that
  model deny as an allowlist: `deny-all` blocks every outbound connection, so an
  agent that works under an allowlist-style deny will not reach package
  registries or model provider hosts here. Leave the capability unset if the
  agent needs either.
- **Fork:** `fork()` snapshots the box and creates a new one from that snapshot,
  the same shape as Docker's commit plus create. It costs a full snapshot round
  trip (about 25 seconds), unlike Docker's local commit.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona and Vercel, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need
  the tunnel in local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Blaxel

```ts
import { blaxelSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-blaxel'

const blaxel = blaxelSandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.BL_API_KEY,
  workspace: process.env.BL_WORKSPACE,
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai) cloud sandbox — a remote VM
  you don't run yourself. Pick the image with `image` (default
  `blaxel/base-image:latest`) and the size with `memory` (default 2048 MB). Set
  `region` (or `BL_REGION`) to choose a region and to silence the SDK's warning
  that it will become required.
- **Auth / env:** Pass `apiKey` and `workspace` as constructor options, or set `BL_API_KEY` and `BL_WORKSPACE`. If you omit the API key, the provider uses the SDK CLI login or client credentials. A requested workspace must match those credentials. `@blaxel/core` authentication is process-global. The provider records the resolved workspace at construction and rejects a later provider that asks for a different workspace.
- **Lifetime:** created sandboxes carry a `1h` TTL by default so an abandoned run
  cannot strand a paid sandbox. Override with `ttl`, or pass `ttl: null` to manage
  lifetime yourself.
- **Resume:** resume-by-id reconnects to the named sandbox, and its filesystem
  is durable across idle suspend/resume for the sandbox's lifetime. Blaxel's
  snapshot/fork API is currently a source-scoped private preview, has no
  entitlement probe, and does not document snapshots surviving source deletion.
  The framework requires `snapshots` to reconstruct after the source is gone, so
  this provider conservatively advertises both `snapshots` and `fork` as `false`
  and does not expose `restoreSnapshot`.
- **Ports:** `ports.connect(port)` creates a per-port preview URL. Previews are
  token-gated by default and the returned channel carries both the token and the
  ready-to-send `X-Blaxel-Preview-Token` header. Set `publicPreviews: true` for
  unauthenticated URLs.
- **Files:** `fs.watch()` is native, so file-event and diff hooks work without polling. `fs.lstat()` reports file, directory, and symlink metadata without following links; missing paths return `undefined`, while other errors propagate. Custom images must provide GNU `stat`.
- **Process output:** stdout and stderr remain live-streamed through bounded
  remote capture pipelines. Concurrent stdout and stderr use labeled records on
  one transport stream, including across keepalive boundaries. Each stream has an 8 MiB total limit; exceeding it
  fails and remotely reaps the process instead of accumulating unbounded logs in
  the provider host. Cancellation uses the same process-group supervisor because
  the pinned SDK does not prove named-process kill reaches child processes.
  Custom images must provide Bash plus `cat`, `mkfifo`, `dd`, `base64`, `tr`,
  and `wc` (the default Blaxel base image does). The supervisor invokes Bash
  explicitly so job-control process groups do not depend on the image's
  `/bin/sh` implementation.
- **Resume semantics:** a destroyed sandbox does not disappear immediately —
  Blaxel keeps the record in a teardown state before purging it. `resume()`
  treats deleting, deactivating, failed, and terminated records as gone, while a
  `DEACTIVATED` sandbox remains resumable consistently with the pinned SDK.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona/Vercel, a remote VM — bridged tools need the tunnel in
  local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## boxd

```ts
import { boxdSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-boxd'

const boxd = boxdSandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.BOXD_API_KEY,
  org: 'acme',
  vcpu: 2,
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [boxd](https://boxd.sh) KVM microVM, a remote VM
  you do not run yourself. Every machine is created `isolated`: no in-VM
  `boxd` CLI, no metadata endpoint, no org integrations, and no peers on the
  org network. The image is Ubuntu 24.04 with Node 24, Python 3, git, Docker,
  and the Claude Code and Codex CLIs preinstalled.
- **Auth / env:** needs `BOXD_API_KEY` (or `apiKey`) and the org the key
  belongs to (`org` or `BOXD_ORG`). Override the endpoint with `baseUrl` /
  `BOXD_BASE_URL`. Harness credentials are injected as workspace secrets and
  travel as per-command env. The API key never enters the machine.
- **Size:** pick `vcpu` (`1`, `2`, or `4`). boxd resolves memory from it:
  4, 8, or 16 GiB. The default is the org's default size. Every machine has a
  100 GB disk.
- **Working directory:** the portable root `/workspace` maps to
  `/home/boxd/workspace`. Override with `workdir`.
- **Cancellation:** if you abort create or snapshot restore during startup,
  the provider tries to delete the new machine after the current SDK call
  finishes.
- **Processes:** `spawn()` opens a streaming exec with separate stdout and
  stderr and a writable stdin. `kill()` signals the process group inside the
  machine and verifies that it is gone, so `killableProcesses` is measured,
  not assumed.
- **Snapshot / resume:** `snapshot()` captures memory and disk into a boxd
  snapshot named `<machine>-<label>` and waits until it is restorable (about
  25 s for an 8 GiB machine). `restoreSnapshot()` boots a new machine from it
  in about 1 s, with the captured processes still running. Resume-by-id
  reconnects to the same machine across stop (2 to 3 s to start), suspend
  (about 140 ms) and hibernate.
- **Fork:** `fork()` is a live boxd fork: disk, memory and running processes,
  ready in under a second.
- **Lifetime:** a machine is persistent until `destroy()`. It suspends after
  `autoSuspendTimeout` idle seconds and hibernates after 4 hours idle by
  default, at no compute cost, and wakes on the next command. Idle means no
  inbound connection. Set `autoDestroyTimeout` as a safety net for abandoned
  sandboxes. `stop` is a power-off: a file written seconds before it can still
  sit in the page cache and be lost, so run `sync` before you stop a machine
  yourself. Suspend, hibernate, snapshot and fork keep memory, so they do not
  lose it.
- **Ports:** every machine has one public HTTPS URL, `https://<name>.boxd.sh`.
  `ports.connect(port)` pins that URL to `port` and returns it. The URL is
  public: anyone who has it can reach the port.
- **Golden image:** pass `fromSnapshot` to boot every new sandbox from a
  snapshot you baked after `setup`, instead of the default image. The size is
  then fixed by the snapshot.
- **Bridge:** like the other cloud providers, it is a remote VM, so bridged
  tools need the tunnel in local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## E2B

```ts
import { e2bSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-e2b'

const e2b = e2bSandbox({ apiKey: process.env.E2B_API_KEY })
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox, a Firecracker microVM
  you do not run yourself. Pick the image with `template` (default: the E2B
  `base` template).
- **Auth / env:** needs `E2B_API_KEY` (or `apiKey`). Set `domain` (or
  `E2B_DOMAIN`) for a self-hosted or BYOC deployment. Harness credentials are
  injected as [workspace secrets](./provisioning). At create and snapshot
  restore they are sent as sandbox `envs`. Per-command `env` goes through the
  SDK's native `envs` argument. No value is written into a command string.
- **Lifetime:** a sandbox lives for `timeoutMs` (default 30 minutes) and is
  killed when that time elapses, so an abandoned run cannot keep billing.
  Resume extends the lifetime by the same amount. Set `onTimeout: 'pause'` to
  keep a timed-out sandbox resumable instead. E2B caps the lifetime at 1 hour
  on the Hobby plan and 24 hours on Pro.
- **Snapshot / resume:** `snapshot()` calls `createSnapshot()`. The sandbox is
  paused briefly, then resumed. `restoreSnapshot()` creates a new sandbox from
  that snapshot, so a snapshot survives deletion of its source. Resume-by-id
  uses `Sandbox.connect`, which also wakes a paused sandbox. A killed or
  expired sandbox resumes as `null`.
- **Fork:** `fork()` is native. The parent is checkpointed in place and the copy
  boots from that checkpoint.
- **Processes:** every command runs as the leader of its own process group
  (`setsid`), so `kill()` reaches backgrounded children. `kill()` always sends
  `SIGKILL`. `spawn()` has a real sandbox pid, a writable stdin, and separate
  stdout and stderr. A custom template must include `setsid` (util-linux); the
  default template has it.
- **Ports:** `ports.connect(port)` returns
  `https://<port>-<sandbox-id>.<domain>`. With `allowPublicTraffic: false` the
  URL is gated by the `e2b-traffic-access-token` header, and the channel carries
  that header in `headers`. Browsers cannot send it, so leave public traffic on
  for preview links a person clicks.
- **Network:** `policy.capabilities.network: 'deny'` maps to
  `allowInternetAccess: false`, which blocks all outbound traffic. E2B's
  per-host allow and deny lists are not reachable through the contract's coarse
  gate.
- **Paths:** the portable root `/workspace` maps to `/home/user/workspace` by
  default. Override with `workdir`. The sandbox user is `user` (not root) with
  passwordless `sudo`, and `/workspace` itself is not writable.
- **Bridge:** like Daytona and Vercel, it is a remote VM, so bridged tools need
  the tunnel in local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## Railway

```ts
import { railwaySandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-railway'

const railway = railwaySandbox({
  environmentId: process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
  region: 'us-west2',
  idleTimeoutMinutes: 30,
  resources: { cpu: 2, memoryGB: 4 },
  // Optional: publish preview domains. Requires PRIVATE networking.
  networkIsolation: 'PRIVATE',
  ports: [3000],
})
```

- **Isolation:** a managed [Railway](https://railway.com) sandbox, a VM you do
  not run yourself, created in a Railway environment. Boot from the base image,
  a named `checkpoint`, or a `Sandbox.template()` recipe (`template`).
- **Auth / env:** the SDK reads `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (a project token) or
  `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` (an account or workspace token). An explicit `token`
  defaults to bearer auth; pass `authType: 'project-token'` for a project
  token. Scope is the environment (`environmentId` or
  `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`), frozen per provider. Harness credentials are
  injected as [workspace secrets](./provisioning): at create and restore they
  are sent as the sandbox's runtime `env`, and per-command `env` travels in the
  exec init frame. No value is written into a command string.
- **Private networking:** with `networkIsolation: 'PRIVATE'` the sandbox joins
  the environment's private network, so the agent can reach your other Railway
  services (databases, internal APIs) by their private hostnames. The default,
  `ISOLATED`, has no private-network access.
- **Lifetime:** Railway destroys a sandbox after `idleTimeoutMinutes` of
  inactivity (plan default when omitted; `0` disables idle destruction where
  the plan allows it). There is no stop/start that keeps the disk, so
  `durableFilesystem` is `false`: use a checkpoint or
  [Portable Snapshots](./portable-snapshots) to keep work across idle expiry.
  `SandboxCreateInput` carries no lifecycle hint, so set the timeout here.
  Resume resets the idle countdown.
- **Size:** `resources: { cpu, memoryGB }` sets vCPU (fractions allowed) and
  memory in decimal GB for every create, restore, and fork. Omitted fields use
  the workspace default; values above its maximum fail at create.
- **Snapshot / resume:** `snapshot(label)` captures a native Railway checkpoint
  named `tsai-<sandbox-id>-<uuid>`. The label stays on the returned ref only,
  because checkpoint names are environment-scoped and a capture replaces an
  existing name. Checkpoints belong to the environment, not the sandbox, so
  `restoreSnapshot()` boots a new sandbox from one after its source is
  destroyed, and reapplies env, network mode, domains, and idle timeout from
  the provider config. Restores and forks run in the source region, so
  `region` applies to fresh sandboxes only. Checkpoints count
  against a per-plan quota and the contract has no delete hook: prune
  `tsai-*` checkpoints you no longer reference with `Sandbox.checkpoints()`
  and `Sandbox.deleteCheckpoint()` from the `railway` SDK. Resume-by-id uses
  `Sandbox.connect`. A missing, `DESTROYED`, `DESTROYING`, or `FAILED` sandbox
  resumes as `null`, a `CREATING` one is awaited, and auth or transport errors
  are rethrown.
- **Fork:** `fork()` is a native live disk fork of the running sandbox into a
  new one in the same environment and region. Processes are not copied. The
  fork gets the parent's network mode, domains, idle timeout, and a copy of
  its env overlay.
- **Processes:** stdout and stderr stay separate. `spawn()` runs in a durable
  exec session with a flow-controlled stdin writer, so it keeps running if the
  host disconnects; this provider does not expose reattach, because TanStack's
  [run journal](./journal) owns run identity. Blocking `exec` runs without a
  durable session and is killed if the connection drops. `spawn()` reports
  `pid: -1` because the exec bridge exposes no remote pid. `kill()` and an
  aborted `exec` send `TERM` to the process group and escalate to `KILL` after
  2 s. An aborted `spawn` sends `KILL` at once. All of them settle on the
  confirmed remote exit. An aborted `exec` resolves with the signalled exit
  code.
- **Cancellation:** if create fails or times out after Railway minted the
  sandbox, or the caller aborts while it boots, the provider tries to destroy
  it. Both are best effort.
- **Ports:** Railway publishes HTTP domains at create time only. Declare them
  with `ports` (at most 10), which requires `networkIsolation: 'PRIVATE'`;
  `ports.connect(port)` returns `https://<domain>` for a declared port and
  rejects any other. Without `ports`, the `ports` capability is `false`. The
  domain is public: it carries no preview token.
- **Network:** `networkPolicy` is `false`. Both modes keep public internet
  egress, so `policy.capabilities.network: 'deny'` is rejected at create
  instead of being dropped.
- **Paths:** the portable root `/workspace` is a real directory created at
  boot. Override with `workdir`. `fs.remove` is recursive (`rm -rf`) and
  `fs.lstat` is a GNU `stat` probe that does not follow symlinks.
- **Bridge:** like the other cloud providers, it is a remote VM, so bridged
  tools need the tunnel in local dev (see [tools](./tools)).

## microsandbox

```ts
import { microsandboxSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-microsandbox'

const microvm = microsandboxSandbox({
  image: 'node:24',
  cpus: 2,
  memoryMiB: 2048,
  ports: [3000],
})
```

- **Isolation:** a [microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox)
  libkrun microVM with its own guest kernel. It runs on the machine that runs
  your app. You do not need a cloud account or a Docker daemon.
- **Needs:** Linux with KVM, macOS on Apple Silicon, or Windows 11 with WHP
  (preview). The `microsandbox` npm package installs the runtime for your
  platform as an optional dependency. Do not install with optional
  dependencies turned off.
- **Image and size:** `image` is any OCI image. The default is `node:24`. Set
  `cpus` and `memoryMiB` to change the size of the guest.
- **Auth / env:** there is no provider login. Harness credentials are
  [workspace secrets](./provisioning). They stay in memory on the handle, and
  each command gets them through the SDK's native env argument. No value is
  written to disk or into a command string.
- **Lifetime:** a sandbox keeps running after your process exits, until
  `destroy()`. Its state lives in `~/.microsandbox` (or `MSB_HOME`). If a
  sandbox with the same id is still there at create, create replaces it.
- **Snapshot / resume:** resume-by-id finds the sandbox by name and starts it
  if it is stopped. The disk is kept across stop and start. `snapshot()` saves
  a disk snapshot to the local snapshot store. `restoreSnapshot()` boots a new
  sandbox from it, also after the source is destroyed. The contract has no
  delete hook, so remove old snapshots with `Snapshot.remove()` from the
  `microsandbox` SDK.
- **Fork:** `fork()` is a native live fork with copy-on-write memory. It took
  about 250 ms in our tests. A fork has no published ports. Fork is not
  available with `allowHostAccess: true` or `network: 'deny'`, so
  `capabilities.fork` is `false` there.
- **Processes:** stdout and stderr stay separate. `spawn()` has a real guest
  pid and a writable stdin. `kill()` sends `SIGKILL` and also stops
  backgrounded children. `kill('SIGTERM')` and other signals go to the
  command's shell only.
- **Ports:** list guest ports in `ports`. Each one is published on a free port
  on `127.0.0.1` at create and at restore. `ports.connect(port)` returns
  `http://127.0.0.1:<host-port>` and rejects a port that is not in the list.
- **Network:** `policy.capabilities.network: 'deny'` turns the guest network
  off.
- **Bridge:** a guest cannot reach your host by default. Set
  `allowHostAccess: true` so that [bridged tools](./tools) work. The guest then
  reaches the host's loopback at `host.microsandbox.internal`, so it can
  connect to every service that listens on `127.0.0.1`. You do not need a
  tunnel.
- **Paths:** the guest user is `root`, and `/workspace` is a real directory.
  Override it with `workdir`.

## Capabilities

Providers declare what they support via `capabilities()`. The flags are:

| Capability | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fs` | Read/write the sandbox filesystem. |
| `exec` | Run commands. |
| `env` | Inject environment variables. |
| `ports` | Expose/forward ports (preview URLs). |
| `backgroundProcesses` | Keep long-running processes alive between calls. |
| `writableStdin` | A spawned process exposes a writable host→process stdin. `true` for local-process, Docker container, Daytona, Upstash Box, E2B, boxd, Railway, and microsandbox. `false` for Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`), Vercel, Sprites, Blaxel, and Cloudflare. When `false`, stdin-fed harnesses write the prompt to a file and redirect it in the shell. |
| `killableProcesses` | A spawned process can be forcibly stopped via `SpawnHandle.kill()` **and** aborted mid-flight via the `signal` passed to `spawn`. |
| `snapshots` | Capture and restore point-in-time snapshots. |
| `networkPolicy` | Enforce network allow/deny rules. |
| `durableFilesystem` | Disk that survives across resumes. |
| `fork` | Branch a sandbox from an existing one. |

Code that uses an **optional** capability checks the flag first and degrades
gracefully. For example, bootstrap only snapshots when `snapshots` is supported,
so `localProcessSandbox` simply skips the step. Calling an unsupported optional
method directly (instead of checking the flag) throws an
`UnsupportedCapabilityError`:

```ts
import { localProcessSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process'

const provider = localProcessSandbox()
const caps = provider.capabilities()

if (caps.snapshots) {
  // safe to take a snapshot
} else {
  // degrade gracefully, local-process has no snapshots
}
```

Use the flags to write provider-agnostic code: branch on the capability rather
than the concrete provider, and your sandbox definition keeps working when you
swap one provider for another.

### `killableProcesses` across the bundled providers

This flag is **measured, not asserted**. A wrong `true` hands the journal reader
an unstoppable `tail -f` and leaks a process per run, so a provider only declares
it once killing has been observed to work against a real sandbox. Two of these
declarations were once `true` on reasoning alone and both turned out to be false
when probed (Docker's stream destroy left the container-side process in `ps`;
local-process's `sh -c` did not `exec`, so killing the shell left the command
alive). Anything that cannot be measured yet stays `false`, because `poll` is
merely slower while a wrong `follow` is a leak.

| Provider | `killableProcesses` | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local process | `true` | **Measured.** Kills the process GROUP, not the wrapper: `detached` spawn plus `process.kill(-pid, signal)` on POSIX (killing only the `sh` left the command running, dash does not reliably `exec`); on Windows `taskkill /T` plus a verified sweep, see [Windows teardown](#windows-process-teardown-logger). |
| Docker | `true` | **Measured.** Signals the process INSIDE the container by the pid the wrapper recorded for itself, process group first and escalating to `KILL`. Destroying the hijacked exec stream is *not* sufficient: it only detaches the client. |
| Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`) | `false` | Unmeasured. Live tests named-skip until `sbx login`. The handle records a pid in the VM, but `killableProcesses` stays `false` until that kill is observed. |
| Daytona | `false` | `kill()` only aborts the client-side poll loop and does not await any termination; the `deleteSession` that might terminate the command runs later from the pump's teardown, is failure-swallowed, and is documented as cleanup for a *completed* session. Unmeasured, needs `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. |
| Vercel | `false` | The abort signal reaches only the HTTP request that STARTS a detached command, so the old `kill()` was a no-op. It now issues the SDK's server-side `Command.kill`, but whether that reaches a forked child (the follow command is a multi-statement shell, so `tail -f` is always a child) is unmeasured, needs Vercel credentials. |
| Sprites | `true` (unverified) | Not a client-side detach: `kill()` issues a real server-side `POST /exec/<sessionId>/kill` before closing the socket. What that endpoint signals (process group or pid) is undocumented and unmeasured; needs `SPRITES_API_KEY`. |
| Upstash Box | `true` | **Measured.** `kill()` sends an allowlisted signal (`TERM`/`KILL`/`INT`/`HUP`) that the box agent delivers to the process TREE server-side, so a forked child is signalled too. Verified against production: a spawned `sleep 5 && touch <marker>` was killed and the marker never appeared. Needs `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`. |
| Blaxel | `true` | The provider reaps supervisor and child process groups, then waits for the remote reaper to finish. Credential-gated journal conformance verifies that cancellation leaves no active follower process. |
| E2B | `true` | **Measured.** The SDK's own kill is a SIGKILL to the shell pid, and a backgrounded `( … ) & wait` child survived it. Every command therefore runs as a `setsid` group leader and `kill()` runs `kill -KILL -- -<pid>` inside the sandbox. The shared journal conformance kill case passes against a real sandbox. Needs `E2B_API_KEY`. |
| Cloudflare | `false` | `kill()` is a no-op, and the caller's `AbortSignal` reaches neither `exec` nor `spawn`, because Workers RPC cannot serialize one. |
| boxd | `true` | **Measured.** The spawn wrapper runs under `setsid`, so the pid it records leads its own process group. `kill()` runs a shell inside the machine that signals that group, escalates to `KILL`, and checks with `kill -0`. Closing the stream alone is not a kill: the process survived it. Verified against production: a spawned `sleep 5 && touch <marker>` was killed and the marker never appeared. Needs `BOXD_API_KEY`. |
| microsandbox | `true` | **Measured.** `kill()` and an aborted `exec` or `spawn` use the SDK's kill, which is a `SIGKILL`. A backgrounded `( sleep 3 && touch <marker> ) & wait` child was stopped too, and the marker never appeared. The shared journal conformance kill case passes against a real microVM on Apple Silicon. Runs with `MICROSANDBOX_LIVE=1`. |
| Railway | `true` | **Measured.** `kill()` and an aborted `exec` send `TERM` to the command's process group and escalate to `KILL` after 2 s. An aborted `spawn` sends `KILL` at once. Each settles only when the remote exit is confirmed. Verified against production: the shared journal conformance kill case passes, and spawned `sleep 5 && touch <marker>` commands (including a backgrounded child) were killed before the marker appeared, for `kill()`, an aborted `exec`, and an aborted `spawn`. Needs `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_TOKEN` + `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`. |

Each of the remote providers registers the shared journal conformance suite, so
the claim is falsifiable rather than asserted: with credentials present the suite
runs against a real sandbox, and without them it reports a **named skip** carrying
the reason instead of a silent pass. Cloudflare's gate is the runtime rather than
credentials, its provider can only create a sandbox through a `Sandbox` Durable
Object binding, which no Node test process has, so its registration is a named
skip saying exactly that, until a Workers-runtime harness can measure it.

This flag is required on every provider, including a bring-your-own one. A
provider that omitted it would be treated as killable, which is the dangerous
default: a follower process started there could never be reclaimed, and it would
keep running inside the sandbox for as long as the sandbox lives.

It is the flag the [run journal](./journal) reads to decide how to tail a run's
output: a killable provider gets a streaming `tail -f`, and a provider like
Cloudflare gets a loop of bounded reads, each of which terminates on its own.

The flag also bounds what *cancel* can mean. On a `false` provider there is no
signal path to the agent process, so the only cancel that actually stops the
agent means destroying the sandbox, which is what the cancel path does. See
[what cancel means on a provider that cannot kill](./takeover#what-cancel-means-on-a-provider-that-cannot-kill).
